Project to create recipe webpages accessible from a homepage. Using entirely HTML I created three recipe webpages utilizing lists, paragraphs, headers, and an image.
The pages maintain an image, a description, a list of ingredients, and the steps to make the dish. 

The pages are all linked to a primary index.html page that content wise only maintains links to the individual recipes. Each recipe page is equiped with a link to the homepage to return to index.html. 

On top of the HTML itself I utilized git and file structure to easily organize and track my project keeping it all in one area.


-----!UPDATE!-----
Now the page is updated with a CSS file linked to the HTML to add some more depth to the blank hyper text markup.
