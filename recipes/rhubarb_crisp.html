        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Commonly paired with strawberries the rhubarb pie is a quintessential spring dessert.
            When the spring's first rhubarb shows up in its young and fresh state, you can trim it in seconds.
            If it has fibrous outer strings, peel them off as you would those of celery.
            Toss the rhubarb in with some orange or lemon juice and zest, and a litle sugar. 
            (This is where you can also sub in strawberries for some pieces of the rhubarb)
            Blend the ingredients for the crisp topping in a food processor, 
            crumble the topping over the rhubarb mixture, and bake --
            it is nerly effortless and as good or better than a pie</p>
